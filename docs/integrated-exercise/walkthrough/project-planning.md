## Planning

To capture the planning of a web project and present it to your client, you need to be clear in which phases the project can be divided.

It’s important to know aspects such as the tasks to be carried out, available resources, unforeseen events that may arise, etc, in order to be able to create a timing that adjusts to reality.

The final delivery time is often given by the client. However, based on your experience, you’ll know how much time you usually spend developing similar web projects.

Therefore, the first thing is to set up the delivery date and then subdivide that final deliverable into parts that will be distributed over the total project time.

We suggest to create your gantt chart via the following link:

## Cost

If you do a cost estimation take the following topics into account:

- Do your estimation in T-shirt sizes (xs, s, m, l, xl)
- T-shirt size XL should be divided in smaller chuncks (more iterations)
- Estimates are hard so make a buffer of 1,5 your estimation
- Do not forget administration and project management tasks, often a 10% markup is taken
- Take your time for iterations based on customer feedback, together with pro-active communication to your client. This will make sure your relation stays healthy
- Always try to go for written consent (e-mails)

Deliverable can look like this:
